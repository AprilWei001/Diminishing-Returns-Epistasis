# Diminishing-Returns-Epistasis
Data and code for Wei and Zhang, 2018

Data and results: in "*.xlsx" 

Code: in "*.m"

The matlab scripts may run differently in Windows and Mac/Linux system. The current files have been writen under Windows environment. If they are needed in Mac or Linux environment, one may try to change the in/output function.
This is mainly because xlswrite() in matlab does not always work outside of Windows environment. Alternatives for output include dlmwrite(), writetable(), fprintf(), and etc. Alternative input could be fopen() or importdata(), and etc.
